# Chart Predictoor 📈

**A real-time BTC price prediction game where your rank changes live as the market moves toward or away from your guess.**

The magic isn't in predicting the exact price—it's watching your position climb and fall in real-time as each price tick brings you closer to victory or defeat. Make your prediction, then experience the genuine tension of live rank tracking during 60-second rounds.

## What It Does

- **Live price predictions** — Guess where BTC will be when the 60-second round ends

- **Instant competition** — Jump in and play immediately, no signup required
- **Mobile responsive** — Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

## How It Works

1. **Join a round** — Rounds sync to the minute, so everyone predicts the same target time
2. **Make your prediction** — Enter your price guess and see it plotted on the live chart
3. **Watch the tension build** — Your rank updates in real-time as the market moves
4. **See who wins** — Closest prediction when time expires takes the round

## Project Status: Archived

This was an experiment in real-time game mechanics. The **live rank visualization worked brilliantly**—that moment when you watch your position change as each price tick comes in creates genuine engagement.

However, 60-second BTC predictions are essentially random. The core mechanic (live rank tracking during market movement) has potential for other applications where skill actually matters.

### Key Learnings

✅ **Live rank updates create real tension**  
✅ **Low-friction entry drives participation**  
✅ **Visual polish significantly impacts engagement**  

❌ **Ultra-short timeframes eliminate skill**  
❌ **No stakes = no lasting engagement**  
❌ **Simulated multiplayer feels hollow**
